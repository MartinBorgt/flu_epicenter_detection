<p>Hey! Welcome to my website! I am going to show you a method for flu epicenter prediction using the drChrono api to
    load patient data and the onpatient api to check if you live near an identified epicenter. In case you do not have
access to a drchrono account with lots of patients in the right area, a set of random patients can be generated and
infected with the flu for a simulation.</p>
